  This is an implementation of the Visitor pattern in a modern C++
  style. The code in this file have been taken and adapted from
  dkorolev :

    https://gist.github.com/dkorolev/8529785d1c692764ddc0
    
  How to use:

  First, we need to define a tuple of all types of visitable objects,
  let's call it TypeList:

      using TypeList = std::tuple<Mesh, Text>;

  Then each class must derive from Visitable<TypeList, ClassType>, i.e.

      class Mesh : public ..., public Visitable<TypeList, Mesh> {};
      class Text : public ..., public Visitable<TypeList, Text> {};

  Then the visitor: 

      class MyVisitor : public Visitor<TypeList> {
      public:
          void visit(Mesh &m) { ... }
          void visit(Text &t) { ... }
      };

  Of course, at the highest level, you should call accept() by passing
  the visitor object.
    
  Notice that adding a new class in the hierarchy requires to modify
  the type list and recompile everything.

  You sometimes need to have a hierarchy of classes that are similar
  to each other. In this case the root of the hierarchy (usually an
  abstract class) is not part of the visitable set of classes, in fact
  we will never actually need to visit the abstract class (there is no
  object of that type). Also, we need a lot of dynamic casts here and
  there, because to call accept we need to first cast to
  AbstractVisitable<TypeList>. That's the price to pay to be generic!

  For example, if Mesh and Text both derive from abstract class Foo,
  then Foo should not derive from Visitable. And if you have a pointer
  to Foo, you must cast it before calling accept. 

      Foo *foo = ...
      dynamic_cast<AbstractVisitable<TypeList> *>(foo)->accept(visitor);

  Therefore, I wrote the helper function accept, so the above becomes:

      Foor *foo = ...
      accept<TypeList>(*foo, visitor);

  The first parameter can be pretty much anything, and if the dynamic
  cast fails, a bad_cast exception is raised. You can also pass a shared_ptr<>.

  (TODO: extend to any kind of reference or pointer).
